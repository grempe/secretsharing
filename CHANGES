== v1.0.0
   Version 1.0.0 is an almost complete rewrite of the original code.
   This version is NOT backwards compatible with the shares generated
   with previous version. The API for this version is significantly
   changed as well. You will need to make some (hopefully simple)
   code changes to use this newer version. See the README.md file
   for details.
== v0.3
   Added support for setting your own secret using the set_fixed_secret()
   method.

== v0.2
   Bugfix in Langrange interpolation, which broke 2/2 sharing.
   Added secret_password method to represent the secret in Base64.

== v0.1
   Initial version
