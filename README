== Description
   A libary for sharing secrets in an information-theoretically secure way.
   It uses Shamir's secret sharing to enable sharing a (random) secret between
   n persons where k <= n persons are enough to recover the secret. k-1 secret
   share holders learn nothing about the secret when they combine their shares.

   This library is based on the OpenXPKI::Crypto::Secret::Split Perl module used
   in the open source PKI software OpenXPKI, which was written by Alexander Klink
   for the OpenXPKI project in 2006.

   It has been further enhanced for Ruby, and a full minitest test suite added,
   by Glenn Rempe.

== Prerequisites
   This package requires Ruby 1.8.7 or later.

   The 'bundler' gem should be installed if you want to
   do development or testing for this gem.

== Installation Instructions

   gem install secretsharing

   - or -

   # Add the following to your Gemfile
   gem "secretsharing", ">=0.3"

== Installation Instructions for Development
   bundle install
   rake test
   rake install

== Usage

   require 'secretsharing'

   # create an object for 3 out of 5 secret sharing
   s = SecretSharing::Shamir.new(5,3)

   # create a random secret (returns the secret)
   s.create_random_secret

   # show secret
   puts s.secret

   # show password representation of secret (Base64)
   puts s.secret_password

   # show shares
   s.shares.each { |share| puts share }

   # recover secret from shares
   s2 = SecretSharing::Shamir.new(3)

   # Accepts SecretSharing::Shamir::Share objects or
   # string representations thereof
   s2 << s.shares[0]
   s2 << s.shares[2]
   s2 << s.shares[4]
   puts s2.secret
